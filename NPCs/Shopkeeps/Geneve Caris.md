Geneve is a shopkeep in [[Zemra]] who runs the general goods store. She is known for taking almost anything as payment, as long as it's corporeal in some way (no, she does not accept firstborn children or names).

Her shop contains pretty much anything that one can find in a standard DnD general goods store, ranging from clothes to groceries to minorly magical items.

She has been described as kindhearted and soft-spoken, despite rumors surrounding a possible past in a secret ops division of the military.
