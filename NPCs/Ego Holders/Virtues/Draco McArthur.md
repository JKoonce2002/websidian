Draco is the holder of [[The Tower]], but is not as evil as that Ego would lead you to believe. He is an architect from Sven Acolas, a city in [[Nolan]]'s Lastwall Lich campaign.

He felt out of place in a place with such brutal architecture when he just wants to make things that he thinks are "fun", which led him to create the [[Fungeon of Pun Ishment]].

Draco is well-spoken and whimsical, and simply wants to bring as much fun as he can into the world.
