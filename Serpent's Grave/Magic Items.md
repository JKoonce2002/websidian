Magic items make up the central economy of [[Serpent's Grave]] and are split into two major categories:
- Modern magic items are those made by engineers, researchers, and the [[Academy Arcane]]. Since they are imitations of more powerful items without enough latent magic to back up their properties, they are either very low-grade or break shortly after being used.
- Natural magic items are rare, since they either come from the ruins explored by adventurers of [[The Silver Hook]] or the [[Feywild]]. Most of these are trinkets, but some (highly rare) are more powerful. These almost always require attunement and tend to grow with their user.

Each member of [[The Party (Serpent's Grave)]] has a natural magic item, and the confirmed/known ones are:
- [[Alaric Ulfberht]]'s *Snakebone Rapier*
- [[Sapa Fua'auro]]'s *Bell of Fey Detection*
- [[Avery]]'s *Gauntlet of Shifting*
- [[Oculin Alba]]'s *Sapphire Ring*
