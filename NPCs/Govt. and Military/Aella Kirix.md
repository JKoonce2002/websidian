Aella is arguably the most well-known face in [[Zemra]], as she runs both its tavern and militia.

Though she once held a decently high rank in the military (she won't say what), she gave it up due to unknown reasons to settle down.

She is headstrong, capable, and a tough-love kind of person who looks after everyone in the town to the best of her ability. That doesn't mean she'll go easy on them in a drinking competition.
