This is the field where [[The Party (Ego)]] first landed in [[Atma]]. It is known as a place where many powerful monsters show off in competitions of strength and guile, typically for the purposes of proving one's mettle to a mate.

These competitions often make the field dangerous to stay in, which is why [[Rasae]] has given it the moniker "The Splash Zone".
