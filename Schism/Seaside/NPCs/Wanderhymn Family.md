This is a family of morticians from [[Duomin (Feyside)]]. They live in the Shire of [[Invern]] and have done so for many generations. The members of the family are:
- Amity: Matriarch of the household, she is a Grave Cleric who handles the rituals surrounding funerary rights and such
- Fen: Patriarch of the household, he is a Spores Druid who handles the burial of bodies. His process allows the body to return to nature's embrace. He has met [[Glen]], but thought he was just another person who cared for the cycle of nature
- [[Ryn Wanderhymn|Ryn]]: See her specific note for details. She is the eldest child
- Mycenus: The quiet, reserved middle child of the family. Following almost directly in his father's footsteps, but with his mother's more calm disposition
- Lycoris: A married undying warlock whose husband is his lich patron. They were married before the contract, mind you. He's big on the paranormal
