This is the name of both the campaign and the 'city' that the campaign takes place in. As the name mildly implies, the city is built into the skeleton of the [[Sky Snake]]. It is comprised of two main sections, connected by an elevator and staircase:
[[The Spine]]: The upper-class area which exists on floating sections of bone located around, you guessed it, the spine of the snake.
[[The Coils]]: The lower-class area which exists on the ground inside the bones of the snake's skeleton. 

In the city, magic items are about while magic itself is sparse. As such, most magic items have limited use.
