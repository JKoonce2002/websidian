A story told to [[Alaric Ulfberht]].

In the desert, [[Honor]] and [[Char]] got caught in a sandstorm and took shelter in a mound that happened to be a krythic hive. Fighting their way out, they found their way into a room with what seemed to be a naturally formed obelisk with a silver tip.

The obelisk formed a portal to a jungle with "impossible creatures" with a pink and purple sky, indicative of the [[Feywild]].
