One of the first Ego Holders to appear, Elias and [[Rasae]] were originally friends who pursued their ideals of justice in this new world. However, they eventually fell out over disagreements in how to *enforce* that justice.

Holding the [[Death]] Ego, Elias has played a part in almost all major conflicts in [[Atma]], and his presence almost certainly spells the death of someone there.

He is a member of the [[Atma Bureau of Planar Management]], working as the psychopomp for subplanes that are unable to produce their own.
