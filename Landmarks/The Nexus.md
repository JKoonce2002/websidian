A small building in [[Zemra]], just off the main block to the east, The Nexus is one of the most important buildings in [[Atma]].

On the exterior, it looks like a polytheistic church. On the interior, it looks similar, and seems to have a priest who oversees its day-to-day operation.

It contains 8 alcoves and a central statue, each with a small offering bowl and a row or two of seats available.

Each of these alcoves represents a different campaign, a world created by a person from Earth, all of which make up a single multiverse of which Atma is the central plane.

The campaigns represented are:
-Furies/Fates
-Serpent's Grave
-Magiboza
-Saltwater Mysteries
-Golden Drakes
-Lastwall Lich
-Halliard
-Cthulhu's Cellphone
