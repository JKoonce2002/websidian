Though there are two Sanctums, mentioning it to someone will almost always have them thinking about the one in [[The Coils]].

Run by the [[Keepers of the Forgotten]].

Consists of a reception desk, sitting area, library, and a large collection of alcoves depicting various deities. Each alcove contains an offering bowl and some depiction of the deity or concept the alcove is dedicated to.

The two alcoves specifically depicted in-session thus far are:
- A worn alcove where there is a statuette of a serpent with a skull over its head, depicting the cult of the [[Sky Snake]]. This statue has been used to connect with what was thought to be the snake, but as it turns out may just be [[Coralaendryn]].
- An alcove decorated with a mural of flowers from all sorts of different planes, representing the beliefs of freedom, change, and general kindness.

Alcoves described include:
- A small shrine devoted to Snesus
