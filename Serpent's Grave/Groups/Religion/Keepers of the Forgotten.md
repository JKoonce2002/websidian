The Keepers of the Forgotten provide sanctums and spaces for people to worship whatever deities they desire (see [[Sanctum of the Forgotten]]). They believe that people should be able to choose whatever religion feels most meaningful to them, and they spend a lot of time trying to uncover ancient long-forgotten religions in the hopes that they might resonate with someone today. The Keepers have sanctums both sides of the city, although the sanctum in [[The Coils]] is much more often visited. (from the campaign intro doc)

Known Keepers include: 
- Water genasi Melindra Mist
- Dwarf [[Drae Oathbreaker]]
- Tiefling [[Zeal Caulder]] (librarian)
