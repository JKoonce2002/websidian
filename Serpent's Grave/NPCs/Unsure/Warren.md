Warren is a wandering merchant in [[The Desert]] with a shop he calls Warren's Wares. He also has a camel that is incredibly hateful and envious.

Warren's Wares sells fake magical artifacts, and the ones that *do* have magic he doesn't know what that magic is.

[[Alaric Ulfberht]] sold him some lantern oil that he passed off as "Oil of Revealing", capable of revealing any magically concealed text.
