The Iron Hand is the guild of mercenaries operating out of [[The Coils]]. They have swords for hire to anyone who can pay the price, and theyâ€™re known for not asking too many questions about the job itself. A largely neutral force, they tend to stay out of most conflicts and maintain a strict policy of selling swords to anyone who can pay, regardless of allegiance or political aims. The head of the Iron Hand, a burly gnome by the name of [[Breom Dirthusk]], is very much not a pencil-pusher, and often goes out on assignments personally at the request of wealthier patrons of the guild.
