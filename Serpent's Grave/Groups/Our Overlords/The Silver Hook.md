By far the wealthiest guild in the city, the Silver Hook is the merchant’s guild largely responsible for turning [[Serpent's Grave]] into the bustling hub of magical item trade that it remains to this day. The guild was founded by [[Sylmon Faerin]], an eladrin pirate turned merchant whose wrist bears the hook from which the guild derives its name. While the guild trades in just about every manner of goods and resources, its main source of income comes from the magical item trade. The guild hires adventurers and mercenaries to search nearby ruins for magical fragments and ruined artifacts, and then sells those artifacts to the [[Academy Arcane]] at a steep price. On the rare occasion that a fully functional item is dug up, those items are sold for huge sums of money directly to the city’s wealthy elite. (from the campaign intro doc).
