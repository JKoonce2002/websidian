An Ego is a unique ability possessed by those who entered [[Atma]] from other worlds. There can only be up to 22 Ego Holders in the world at any given time, due to the fact that each Ego corresponds to one of the Major Arcana.

The purpose of an Ego is twofold:
1. To help the holder realize their truest, ideal self. The nature of each person pairs with the nature of a tarot card to produce an Ego Holder.
2. To give people from other worlds some degree of control over Atma. Since they have been removed from the cycle of fate in their own world, they must find their own way or, in the least, be agents of fate in Atma.
