Zeal is the librarian at the [[Sanctum of the Forgotten]].

He is a red tiefling who is very knowledgeable about the deities in the alcoves there, and even helped [[Sapa Fua'auro]] find a religion that he likes.

Has some unclear relationship with [[Oculin Alba]], one which makes her very upset when she thinks about him.
