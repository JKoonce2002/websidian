The Council is the assembly of the cityâ€™s thirteen most powerful wizards and sorcerers. They effectively rule the city of [[Serpent's Grave]], having final say in all administrative matters that apply to the city as a whole. They tend to favor policies that increase the research and production of new modern magical items and practices, with the advancement of modern magic being their primary concern. Each wizard generally has one or two apprentices who hold a great deal of power and status in the city. (from campaign intro doc).
