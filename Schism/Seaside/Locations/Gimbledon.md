The hometown of [[Crimble]], located somewhere on the [[Isle of Deeplight]]. Created by an offshoot tribe of the [[United Goblin Nations of Okeani]], Gimbledon is home to a number of monstrous races who take care of day-to-day operations of the Isle. There is also an aquarium (featuring such hits as a leviathan(who was sentenced to exile by [[Emperor Leviathan Deep Echo|Decho]]) named Frederick and a pacifistic aboleth named Humphrey), an ice cream shop, and more!
