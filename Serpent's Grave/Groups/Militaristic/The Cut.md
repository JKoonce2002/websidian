Spoken of in hushed whispers, the Cut is the largest thieves’ guild in [[The Coils]]. Most small businesses in the Coils are required to pay a protection fee to the Cut, or else risk having their wares stolen and their business trashed. The identity of the leader of the Cut is unknown, as are the identities of most of its members. Most of the residents of the Coils consider the organization as one to be avoided at all costs. Although members of the Cut don’t often venture upward, there are occasional tales of fabulous treasures getting stolen from under the noses of the Spine’s wealthiest residents. Whether these tales are fact or fiction is largely unknown. (from campaign intro doc)

Their front organization is the [[Bureau of Business Management]], something that can be easily found out but not so easily said.
