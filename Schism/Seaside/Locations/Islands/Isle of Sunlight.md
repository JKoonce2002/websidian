One of the three primordial islands (The others being [[Nowhere]] and the [[Isle of Deeplight]]) located on [[Halliard]], the Isle of Deeplight is a deeply spiritual place, having been formed by primordial forces before the [[Progenitors]] shaped the plane as they saw fit.

The Isle is a fir tree forest always covered in a light (or heavy) blanket of snow, frost, or ice. The island gets its name from the intense bright light that reflects off of the frozen ground and from the fact that it is the main home of the Aurora Borealis on the Seaside.

It is known for being the home to monasteries, temples, and other places dedicated to the Light arts and [[The Pantheon of Halliard||divinities]].
