Named for the griffin mounts on which its couriers ride, the Griffin’s Wing is [[Serpent's Grave]]'s largest newspaper and message courier service. In charge of delivering information from one side of the city to the other, the Wing is staffed by journalists, investigative reporters, and news couriers who ride griffins to deliver important messages throughout the city and beyond. The Wing is run by the extremely charming [[Vivian Verbose]], who clawed her way up to the top by virtue of her forceful personality and sharp wit. It’s said that every secret in the city finds its way into her richly decorated office before being selectively delivered to the right ears. (from campaign intro doc).
