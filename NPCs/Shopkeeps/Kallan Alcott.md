Kallan is a shopkeep in [[Zemra]] who runs a cafe on a backstreet near the library. He is almost always seen with tea in hand, and his favorite blend is jasmine and lavender with honey and a little bit of salt.

The cafe mostly serves a wide variety of teas, but also has some local coffee.

Most of the kids in Zemra refer to him as uncle or grandad despite the fact that he has no family in town. This is due to his gentle and calming demeanor and willingness to provide a place of respite for weary traveler and townsperson alike.
