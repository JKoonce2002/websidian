Grobnar is the blacksmith in [[Zemra]]. A bit too large for most spaces, he mostly keeps to his shop, the general store (it's more open-air anyway), and [[Kallan Alcott]]'s cafe (Kallan had a special-order door made so he could more easily fit inside).

The smithy itself sells all manner of weaponry and armor, and though Grobnar will never openly admit it his enchanting is not too shabby. 

Strong of will, rough of tongue, big of heart, and dumb of ass, Grobnar has everything you want in a fantasy blacksmith.
