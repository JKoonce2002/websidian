A group of essentially cultists who hunt down people with "blood curses", such as vampirism and lycanthropy. 

They are a majorly antagonistic group, as the initiators and sole propogators of the Shifter Hunt. 

Their only confirmed members mentioned in-session thus far are [[Elix]], the [[Half-Orc Man]] who was accompanying him, and the people who killed [[Constantine]] (half-orc man included).
