Callista is a shopkeep in [[Zemra]] who runs the herbalism shop.

Her shop is located near the entrance of the town, and has a number of herbs, both magical and otherwise.

She has been described as straightforward and honest to a fault, but tends to keep to herself (or at least to the confines of her shop).

She seems to have taken an interest of some kind in [[Ash]].
