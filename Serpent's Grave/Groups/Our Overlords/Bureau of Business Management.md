Headed by [[Irene Gambio]], the BBM serves as a front organization for [[The Cut]] and also a way for them to justify their busting of businesses and establish more pieces to their information network.

They are not an official government organization, but the central government of the city doesn't particularly care about [[The Coils]] so they are pretty much just allowed to operate as if they are.

They do provide some protections, even though it is very much a "nobody messes with them but me" mentality.
