One of the three primordial islands (The others being [[Nowhere]] and the [[Isle of Sunlight]]) located on [[Halliard]], the Isle of Deeplight is a deeply spiritual place, having been formed by primordial forces before the [[Progenitors]] shaped the plane as they saw fit.

It is a savannah whose name comes from the bitterly cold nights, beautiful sights of constellations, and the bioluminescent creatures which find their way around its shores on a nightly basis.

It is known for being the home to monasteries, temples, and other places dedicated to the Dark arts and [[The Pantheon of Halliard||divinities]].
