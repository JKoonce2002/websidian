The old fae queen. Pronounced coral-AND-ryn.

Thought of to be fully dead until recently, when [[Alaric Ulfberht]] learned that he has a contract with her and shouted her name, causing him to begin having visions. Not much is known about her personality aside from the emotions felt in those visions.

The event that caused her apparent death was the same that killed the [[Sky Snake]], as she fell off of it carrying a person that Alaric could not see in the vision, due to them being "too painful to look at". In the second vision Alaric felt, he found that her essence was shattered and mixed with the blood of the Sky Snake, creating a number of [[Wellsprings]] of magic.

When asked about what she wants, the answer given was a number of emotions: old grief, once-potent rage, and overwhelming bitterness. This matches the emotions Alaric felt during the vision: extreme grief and the beginnings of rage.

Was recently discovered to be the source of the feelings felt at the snake statue in the [[Sanctum of the Forgotten]], which may be because (as Ash mentioned in an offhand comment in a session), the only way Coralaendryn could have stayed alive this long is by binding her essence to the snake's skeleton.
