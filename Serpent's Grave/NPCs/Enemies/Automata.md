Not NieR, but most certainly automata, these have been the central enemies of the group so far.

Automata Count: 3
- The mixed water/fire elemental one, with a core seeming to derive from something the [[Alba Family]] would make (attack in the central marketplace of the coils).
- The sword one who could affect the environment based on what magical damage they were hit with (list down the way).
- The shield one who was mostly there to protect the sword one (paired with the sword during the attack at [[The Gilded Lily]]).


Sword automata's damage reflections
- Psychic: Spatial distortions making it harder to attack
- Poison: Poison gas
- Lightning: Arc lightning betwixt all metal objects in the room
- Thunder: Everything becomes super loud
- Force: Physical attacks have a heavier impact
- Necrotic: HP max lowered in AOE
