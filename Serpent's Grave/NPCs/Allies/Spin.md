Spin is a changeling and [[The Party (Serpent's Grave)]]'s surrogate child. They are an incredibly proficient Arcane Trickter Rogue.

Due to recent events, it was learned that Spin may have some connection to [[Coralaendryn]] or the [[Feywild]], due to their particularly adverse reaction to [[Alaric Ulfberht]] saying the Queen's name.

Spin is known for having fun names for spells. They include:
- See Real Good = Detect Magic
- See Real Good, the Other One = See Invisibility (If I remember correctly)
- Make Guard Not Mad For a Minute = Friends
- Make Guard Not Mad For an Hour = Charm Person
- Sneak Real Good = Invisibility

While using "See Real Good", Spin has specific names for the colors of schools of magic. They are based on the color and the next fruit Spin stole after seeing it for the first time.
- Blue Raspberry = Divination
- Pink Cherry = Enchantment
- Purple Apple = Transmutation
- Spicy Lime = Evocation
- Green Apricot = Illusion
