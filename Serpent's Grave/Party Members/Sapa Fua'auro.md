Member of [[The Party (Serpent's Grave)]]. Played by Kaitlyn.

Sapa is a Naga from the [[Feywild]] who is having a bit of trouble adjusting to the prime material plane and its distinct lack of magic.

Worked in a carnival while connected to the Feywild, and for a time at [[The Gilded Lily]], which made the third attack by the [[Automata]] all the more emotionally charged for him.

During the carnival, Sapa did arrow-swallowing instead of sword-swallowing

Is the closest party member to [[Spin]].

Sapa can smell magic, and has described magic as such:
- Mint = Evocation
- Cardamom = Transmutation
- Coffee = Enchantment
- Lavender = Abjuration
- Cayenne = Illusion
