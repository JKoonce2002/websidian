Lilith was the second fellow Earther that [[The Party (Ego)]] met in [[Atma]], and the first that tried to kill them. After framing the party for murder, she was tracked down on the path to the capital.

During the fight, the players learned that she held the ego of [[The Hanged Man]], which made the fight a little tougher than normal.

Items of note were her iPhone 14, running on iOS 17, her rapier which can turn into a cat, and the card of her Ego.
