Officially the city guard for all of [[Serpent's Grave]], the Shield is nevertheless almost exclusively seen patrolling the upscale neighborhoods and research labs of the Spine. The Shield is led by Guard Captain [[Mirelle Oren]], a famed tiefling pit fighter turned adventurer turned bodyguard for the cityâ€™s wealthy, and eventually turned captain of the city guard. The Shield has a heavy peacekeeping presence in [[The Spine]] but only ventures downward on rare occasions, often escorting people of import. (From the campaign intro doc)
