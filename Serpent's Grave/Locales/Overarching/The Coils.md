The lower-class area of [[Serpent's Grave]] which exists on the ground inside the bones of the snake's skeleton. This is the main setting for the campaign, and is where everything except for a brief few scenes have happened. 

Arguably, this is where the most action is. In the least, it's where [[The Party (Serpent's Grave)]] has been pretty much the whole time.
