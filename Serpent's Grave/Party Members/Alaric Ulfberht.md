Member of [[The Party (Serpent's Grave)]]. Played by Jeff.

A dhampir (originally a half-eladrin) bard whose main motivation (and dream) is to become the main character of a legend, an epic, or some other great story to be passed about for centuries.

Son of [[Bianca Cherith]] and [[Barrat Ulfberht]].

Owner and creator of [[Grindstone Grotto]].

Has a big 'ol crush on [[Irene Gambio]], and keeps up hope even though she has rejected him a record 69 times.

His vampiric hunger is attention, which is in ample supply due to the number of stories about him. His rapier is made of a fragment of bone from the [[Sky Snake]] and has some levitative properties.

He has a contract of unknown specifics with [[Coralaendryn]], one in which all he knows is that she siphons some of the psychic energies that he collects.

Once had a dream about floating into the head of the sky snake, and when he got there he became incredibly drained of his psychic food. This is how he learned that one part of the contract.

Recently had a skosh of an egodeath upon living the experiences of Coralaendryn's death in a dream, including the process of having one's essence shattered. It is fully his fault, though. The first vision was brought about by him shouting the queen's name; the second (which implicated a large number of residents in the city) was brought about by him asking whether the proper tense for Coralaendryn's being the queen was present or past.

Currently has a bit of the color drained from his fingers after the visions took their course.
