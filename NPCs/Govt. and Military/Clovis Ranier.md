Clovis is the mayor of [[Zemra]] and an active member of the community.

He is a strong believer in leading by doing, and can regularly be seen about town helping with general maintenance and upkeep. Unfortunately, though, as a person with a bureaucratic position, he is most often in his office in City Hall doing paperwork. 

He consistently denies the formation of a formal police or military force, banking on good-will, the small size of the community he presides over, and a decently active informal militia run by [[Aella Kirix]].

The item he is most known for having is the Gambit, a portable Zone of Truth which can detect if someone fails the save.
