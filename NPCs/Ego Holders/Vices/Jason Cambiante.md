Jason is the librarian in [[Zemra]]. He happened to look a lot like [[Jeff]] when he was first encountered, but the similarities have faded as everyone gets more used to the world around them and they saw him without his reading glasses.

One of the first quests in the oneshot was the case of the unreturned library book, in which it was learned that [[Callista Sinensis]] had an overdue library book. Turns out, this 'book' was just what Jason keeps his condoms in.

Jason is described as laid-back and hard to impress. It's a shame he only uses his superhuman people-reading skills for helping with book suggestions.

He holds [[The Hierophant]] Ego.
