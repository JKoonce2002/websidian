Jerry Greg Johnson, Jr., is a fledgeling knight from the capital and the newest addition to [[Zemra]]'s militia. He moved out of an admiration for [[Aella Kirix]], who is the main person that Jerry responds to.

Jerry is usually posted on gate duty. Though this is mostly an aside role, as Zemra rarely gets visitors, it is one he treats with the utmost care.

Capable with a sword but not with his words (or a dishcloth, or an oilcloth, or a grindstone, you get the picture), Jerry is a lovable quasi-mascot for the militia. Or at least he *would* be if it weren't for his pet, [[Pippin the Squirrel]], stealing the show.
