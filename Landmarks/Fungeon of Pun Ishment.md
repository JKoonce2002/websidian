This was [[Draco McArthur]]'s first attempt at creating a dungeon. He took over [[Irthir]]'s "lair", which was little more than a cave with a few books in it outside of [[Zemra]]. 

The map that [[The Party (Ego)]] had as they went through this dungon which auto-populated with the puns they encountered

There was at least one pun in every room, and the list is as follows
- Gnoll: the knoll that the dungeon was made inside of, having a large gnoll skull as its entrance
- Elemental of Surprise: A "fire snake" with non-fire elemental abilities
- Psywrens: Birds which dealt psychic damage through song
- Bee Holder: A beekeeper equipped with a Jar of Bees
- A Bee Airy: The half apiary, half aviary where the previous two were
- Auntie Chamber: an antechamber containing an aunt
- Lame-ia: A lamia who is not the most fun to bring to parties
- Arch Enemy: A mimic in arch shape
- Wear Wolves: People in wolf onesies
- GI Ants: Soldier ants
- White: unrendered wight
- Bookwyrm: [[Irthir]], the dragon who hoards books
