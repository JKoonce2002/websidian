This is the classification system of subplanes used by the [[Atma Bureau of Planar Management]].

- Class A refers to a world in which campaigns have (and can) actively take(n) place. If a campaign is not currently ongoing, the nature of the Class A subplane is such that it would only take the formation of a party for a full-length campaign to start
- Class B refers to a world in which a campaign has taken place, but something that should have happened didn’t, and now it’s stabilized in a way that doesn’t allow for more than low-level campaigns or oneshots.
- Class C is a world either in entire upheaval (thereby preventing consistent adventuring) or where no campaigns can take place. Oneshots only, awaiting an event that can bump it to Class A.
- Class D worlds are stable in a way that makes them impossible for more than a low-level oneshot. Worlds devoid of life, worlds where conflicts have all been solved, true utopias, etc.

The current list of Class-A subplanes is as follows
- [[Serpent's Grave]]
